## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r load libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(broom)
library(gapminder)
library(ggfortify)

```


```{r call bridge and weather data}

source("weather_data.R")

bike_weather


```

```{r call r-square}
model_df_glance

```


```{r call stats}
model_df_tidy

```


```{r call plot}
source("Transform.R")

```

```{r}
bike_month
```

```{r}

```
